       <div className="lead text-left"><mark><a href="https://twitter.com/emwblog" > @EMWBlog</a></mark></div> <p> Hello and
        welcome to EMW. Who are you and what do you do?</p>

    <div className="lead text-left"><mark className="second"><a
    href="https://twitter.com/SimonParton" >@SimonParton</a></mark></div> <p>Hello!
    My name is Simon Parton and I’m a musician living and working in Swansea. I
    am one half of the team coordinating the Swansea Music Hub & Swansea Fringe
    Festival (alongside Joe Bayliss). We both also teach, deliver music
    workshops and produce & compose our own music too.</p>

    <div className="lead text-left"><mark><a href="https://twitter.com/emwblog" > @EMWBlog</a></mark></div> <p>Last year you
    organised Swansea Fringe. Tell us more about this and what it involved. What
    did you learn by hosting such an exciting and varied cultural event?</p>

    <div className="lead text-left"><mark className="second"><a
    href="https://twitter.com/SimonParton" >@SimonParton</a></mark></div> <p>I was
    asked by Joe to help with the Fringe last year and I think Joe will agree,
    we aimed high with over 150 acts across over 15 venues which meant we learnt
    a lot very quickly. It showcased a cross section of music, comedy, poetry
    and arts, but as we are both musicians there was a big focus on music.  I
    think one of the most useful things that we learnt from the event is that
    there are so many amazing creative things happening in Swansea and so many
    like minded people wanting our music scene to flourish.</p>

    <div className="lead text-left"><mark><a href="https://twitter.com/emwblog" > @EMWBlog</a></mark></div><p>What were your
    personal highlights from this event?</p>

    <div className="lead text-left"><mark className="second"><a
    href="https://twitter.com/SimonParton" >@SimonParton</a></mark></div><p> In
    between running around delivering PAs, drum kits and everything in between
    to venues I was fortunate enough to catch some of the things that we had
    booked in! Personal highlights were Trampolene, Afro Cluster, Rachel K
    Collier & Roughion on the Horizons stage in Cinema & Co, and the Atomic
    Supermen in Tech Hub.</p>

    <div className="lead text-left"><mark><a href="https://twitter.com/emwblog" > @EMWBlog</a></mark></div><p> You are both
    musicians in your own right. How important is community for you as a
    creative?</p>

    <div className="lead text-left"><mark className="second"><a
    href="https://twitter.com/SimonParton" >@SimonParton</a></mark></div> <p>It’s
    absolutely paramount for me and the way that I make music. The majority of
    my creative output recently has been all about collaboration. With my
    projects Belgrave and Friends, it’s all about sending files and projects
    over the internet and linking up with artists and musicians that we’ve met
    through the music scene. More recently I’ve been discovering lots of new
    music through organising our music directory on the site and it’s been great
    to reach out to artists to get creative and collaborate with them.</p>

    <div className="lead text-left"><mark><a href="https://twitter.com/emwblog" > @EMWBlog</a></mark></div><p>What triggered
    you to start the Swansea Music Hub Page?</p>

    <div className="lead text-left"><mark className="second"><a
    href="https://twitter.com/SimonParton" >@SimonParton</a></mark></div><p> So
    after the Swansea Fringe Festival we felt a huge buzz for the potential of
    the Swansea Music Scene and we didn’t want this to go away or only happen
    once a year. We wanted to show that Swansea has a wealth of not only great
    musicians, artists and venues, but also a huge potential for audiences (both
    new and old) to get out, experience and support original music from the
    city.</p>

    <div className="lead text-left"><mark><a href="https://twitter.com/emwblog" > @EMWBlog</a></mark></div><p> Taking a look
    at the page. There is an amazing list of performers, composers and producers
    slowly building. How has the initial response been?</p>

    <div className="lead text-left"><mark className="second"><a
    href="https://twitter.com/SimonParton" >@SimonParton</a></mark></div><p>It’s
    been overwhelmingly positive. We keep discovering new artists and musicians
    from different communities within the larger scene that we have never heard
    of and that’s been really exciting. Getting different musicians from
    different parts of Swansea and genres all in one place is great and opens
    dialogue between artists that may never have made contact before. This was
    true at our musician’s forum earlier this month - we had people from the
    heavy metal scene expressing the same thoughts, barriers and concerns as
    those from the hip hop and electronic music scenes!</p>

    <div className="lead text-left"><mark><a href="https://twitter.com/emwblog" > @EMWBlog</a></mark></div><p>How easy is the
    current model to maintain. Are you prepared for a large database of
    musicians?</p>

    <div className="lead text-left"><mark className="second"><a
    href="https://twitter.com/SimonParton" >@SimonParton</a></mark></div><p> At the
    moment, it’s pretty manageable. As both myself and Joe teach and are doing
    the Swansea Music Hub voluntarily it means that we can take things at our
    own pace. Every week I’m spending time searching for new artists to add to
    the directory, new gigs and reaching out to artists to let us know about any
    live shows / releases that are coming out of Swansea. We currently have over
    100 artists listed on our directory and we’d love it to grow even more.</p>

    <div className="lead text-left"><mark><a href="https://twitter.com/emwblog" > @EMWBlog</a></mark></div><p>Where can you
    see Swansea Music Hub going as a platform. What are your visions and dreams for the
    future?</p>

    <div className="lead text-left"><mark className="second"><a
    href="https://twitter.com/SimonParton" >@SimonParton</a></mark></div><p> We are
    looking to grow the Hub to a become a sustainable project that offers
    support, education, facilities and events for musicians and those interested
    in music in Swansea. We want it to be a place where ideas, events and
    opportunities can be shared and a place where musicians can come together to
    improve our music scene. We’re hoping that this will not only bring new
    opportunities and develop the music scene, but will also attract bands and
    promoters from other cities to put on shows and events in the city.</p>

    <div className="lead text-left"><mark><a href="https://twitter.com/emwblog" > @EMWBlog</a></mark></div><p>How can the
    music community help you achieve this?</p>

    <div className="lead text-left"><mark className="second"><a
    href="https://twitter.com/SimonParton" >@SimonParton</a></mark></div><p> Shout
    about anything and everything creative that you are doing. Let us know about
    gigs and/or releases of original music that you’re part of. Invite all your
    friends to shows and pack out venues. Use the hashtag:</p>

</figure>


    <p>But, more importantly, support each other. Go to other bands/musicians’
    gigs. Visit venues that you haven’t been to before. It’ll all come full
    circle and you’ll find that more people will support you!</p>

  <div className="lead text-left"><mark><a href="https://twitter.com/emwblog" > @EMWBlog</a></mark></div><p>What would your
    ideal online music community include?</p>

    <div className="lead text-left"><mark className="second"><a
    href="https://twitter.com/SimonParton" >@SimonParton</a></mark></div>
    <p>Dialogue, support and progressive development between musicians, venues and
    those interested in original music.</p>

    <p>Thank you!</p>
